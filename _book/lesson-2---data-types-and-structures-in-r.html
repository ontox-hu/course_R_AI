<div class="tip">
<p>Always think about the variables in your dataset. Are they categorical, continuous or discrete? Let’s say we test different variables in the people in this class:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>continuous variables</strong>: numeric variables that can have any value between any two values. Examples: the hair length (can be anything from 0 to let’s say 400 cm, including for instance 15,36791 cm.), body temperature, pH of a magic potion.</li>
<li><strong>discrete variables</strong>: also numbers, but these numbers can’t be anything between certain limits. They have discrete options. Typically, this is count data, but not always. For instance: the number of people wearing blue shirts (can be 3, 5 or 8, but can’t be 5,36791 or 2,6), the result of rolling a die.</li>
<li><strong>categorical variables</strong>: contain a finite number of categories or distinct groups. For instance, eye colour (blue, brown, green, grey, etc), home town (Utrecht, Amsterdam, Zuidlaren, etc), marital status (married, unmarried).</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are working with a categorical variable, do store it as a factor! R will then recognise it being categorical, and handle it as such when doing calculations or making plots.</p>

<h2>Oefenopdracht (thuis)</h2>
<div class="dagopdracht">
<p>Maak de onderstaande opdrachten m.b.v. R. Noteer de gebruikte R code in een R script. Zorg ervoor dat je de code voorziet van uitleg in de vorm van comments (regels die beginnen met <code>#</code>) en dat je ook de antwoorden op de vragen in de vorm van comments in het R script noteert. Komende les bespreken we deze opdracht.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In deze opdracht ga je werken met de Glass dataset. Deze dataset is een onderdeel van de <code>mlbench</code> package. Dit package is al geïnstalleerd.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Laad het package in R m.b.v. de <code>library()</code> functie.</li>
<li>Open de Glass dataset in R via deze regel code: <code>data(Glass)</code>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Nu je de dataset hebt geopend in R, kun je informatie over de dataset gaan verzamelen:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Wat voor data type (vector, list, data.frame, tibble etc.) is de Glass dataset?</li>
<li>Wat zijn de dimensies (aantal rijen/kolommen) van de Glass dataset?</li>
<li>Gebruik de help functie om informatie te vinden over de Glass dataset. Beschrijf kort in eigen woorden wat voor data deze dataset bevat.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We gaan nu twee kleinere datasets maken uit de Glass dataset:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Maak een nieuwe dataset met daarin alleen de data voor glastype 1. Je kunt hiervoor de volgende code gebruiken: <code>glass1 &lt;- Glass[Glass$Type == 1,]</code>.</li>
<li>Maak ook een nieuwe dataset met daarin alleen de data voor glastype 5. Pas hiervoor de code zoals genoemd bij vraag (a) aan.</li>
<li>Hoeveel metingen (= aantal rijen) zijn er gedaan voor glastype 1? En hoeveel metingen voor glastype 5?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We willen kijken wat de verschillen zijn tussen glastype 1 en glastype 5:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Wat is het gemiddelde ijzergehalte voor glastype 1? En wat is het gemiddelde ijzergehalte voor glastype 5?</li>
<li>Wat is het minimale siliciumgehalte van glastype 5? En wat is het maximale siliciumgehalte van glastype 5?</li>
<li>Is er een verschil in brekingsindex tussen glastype 1 en 5? Beargumenteer je antwoord. Bereken hiervoor de gemiddelde waarden en de standaardafwijking (<code>sd</code> functie in R).</li>
<li>Maak een tibble waarin je de resultaten van opgave 4c samenvat. De kolommen van de tibble zijn ‘glastype’, ‘brekingsindex_gemiddelde’, en ‘brekingsindex_stdev’.</li>
